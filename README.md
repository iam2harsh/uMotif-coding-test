### Case Study
The task is to create a basic, web-based subject screening tool for a clinical trial.
This will require:
• A screening form
• A results page
• A small database
• Writing logic to decide whether a subject is eligible for the trial
The screening form will have fields to capture:
1. The subject’s first name
2. The subject’s date of Birth
3. The frequency with which subject experiences migraine headaches, with response options:
   Monthly, Weekly, Daily
4. The daily frequency with which subject experiences migraine headaches, with response
   options of: 1-2; 3-4; 5+ (only if the response to question 3 is ‘Daily’).
   The form will also have a ‘submit’ buRon. When the form is submitted, the code will determine and display the subject’s eligibility with the following rules:
   • If the subject is under 18 years of age they are ineligible and are shown the message ‘Participants must be over 18 years of age’
   • If the applicant is Over 18 years of age and experiences monthly or weekly migraine headaches they are eligible and are assigned to Cohort A and the results show ‘Participant <name> is assigned to Cohort A’ (where <name> Is the subject’s first name captured on the screening form)
   • If the applicant is Over 18 years of age and experiences daily migraine headaches they are eligible and are assigned to Cohort B and the results show ‘Candidate <name> is assigned to Cohort B’ (where <name> Is the subject’s first name captured on the screening form)
   It should be possible to see the entered screening data and results by looking in the database.
